    abstract = {Most atomic physics experiments are controlled by a digital pattern generator used to synchronize all equipment by providing triggers and clocks. Recently, the availability of well-documented open-source development tools has lifted the barriers to using programmable systems on chip (PSoCs), making them a convenient and versatile tool for synthesizing digital patterns. Here, we take advantage of these advancements in the design of a versatile clock and pattern generator using a PSoC. We present our design with the intent of highlighting the new possibilities that PSoCs have to offer in terms of flexibility. We provide a robust hardware carrier and basic firmware implementation that can be expanded and modified for other uses.},

    abstract = {We describe a many-channel experiment control system based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The system has 16 bit resolution on 10 analog 100 megasamples-per-second (MS/s) input channels, 14 analog 100 MS/s output channels, 16 slow analog input and output channels, dozens of digital inputs and outputs, and a touchscreen display for experiment control and monitoring. The system can support ten servo loops with 155 ns latency and MHz bandwidths, in addition to as many as 30 lower bandwidth servos. We demonstrate infinite-impulse-response (IIR) proportional–integral–differential filters with 30 ns latency by using only bit-shifts and additions. These IIR filters allow timing margin at 100 MS/s and use fewer FPGA resources than straightforward multiplier-based filters, facilitating many servos on a single FPGA. We present several specific applications: Hänsch–Couillaud laser locks with automatic lock acquisition and a slow dither correction of lock offsets, variable duty cycle temperature servos, and the generation of multiple synchronized arbitrary waveforms.},

abstract = {Experiments with trapped ions and neutral atoms typically employ optical modulators in order to control the phase, frequency, and amplitude of light directed to individual atoms. These elements are expensive, bulky, consume substantial power, and often rely on free-space I/O channels, all of which pose scaling challenges. To support many-ion systems like trapped-ion quantum computers or miniaturized deployable devices like clocks and sensors, these elements must ultimately be microfabricated, ideally monolithically with the trap to avoid losses associated with optical coupling between physically separate components. In this work we design, fabricate, and test an optical modulator capable of monolithic integration with a surface-electrode ion trap. These devices consist of piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuits configured as multi-stage Mach-Zehnder modulators that are used to control the intensity of light delivered to a single trapped ion on a separate chip. We use quantum tomography employing hundreds of multi-gate sequences to enhance the sensitivity of the fidelity to the types and magnitudes of gate errors relevant to quantum computing and better characterize the performance of the modulators, ultimately measuring single qubit gate fidelities that exceed 99.7%.},
