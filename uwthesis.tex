%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because

%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation

Modern quantum computing experiments demand exceptional precision, especially when controlling laser pulses for trapped-ion systems. Recent optical breakthroughs now pack dozens of channels onto a single chip, enabling efficient multichannel laser control. However, the supporting electronics often lack the necessary timing accuracy and flexibility. This shortfall can hinder progress and frustrate researchers.

This thesis presents an FPGA-based laser control system on a Xilinx Zynq platform. A key module generates precise pulse waveforms and integrates into a system that delivers 32 pulsed and 32 static voltage signals. By leveraging dual-port block memories, state machines, and high-speed interfaces, the system achieves sub-microsecond timing with low resource usage. Simulation and board testing confirm accurate pulse generation while highlighting opportunities for enhanced precision and improved error handling. Overall, this work offers a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for advanced FPGA applications in quantum control.

I extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me on this journey. I am especially thankful to my advisor, Professor Scott Hauck, whose guidance and unwavering support have been indispensable. Working in his laboratory provided me with incredible opportunities and invaluable resources that enriched my personal, academic, and professional growth.

I also appreciate Professor Sara Mouradian, a valued member of my thesis committee, has been a driving force behind this project. Her strategic vision and deep understanding of its foundations have consistently propelled innovation and advanced its potential.

A sincere thank the ACME lab team for their invaluable help during the process. Special thanks to Geoffrey Jones for initiating the design. His insights and technical effort have shaped every corner of the system.

I truly appreciate the support of my friends and family. I am thank to Buke Hu from QT3 Laboratory for providing essential publications on the projectâ€™s application, and to ACME alumni Jeffery Xu for his technical guidance during the design phase. Lastly, I owe my deepest appreciation to my mother, Dr. Li Yang, whose constant encouragement has been a cornerstone of my journey.
